    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>1. What is the difference between var, let & const?
        </strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>var :</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>The scope of a var variable is functional scope.</li>
        <li>It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.</li>
        <li>It can be declared without initialization.</li>
        <li>It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is "undefined".</li>
        <li>hoisting done , with initializing as 'default' value</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>let :</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>The scope of a let variable is block scope.</li>
        <li>It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.</li>
        <li>It can be declared without initialization.</li>
        <li>It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give 'referenceError'.</li>
        <li>Hoisting is done , but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the let variable before
            declaration/initialization</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>const :</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>The scope of a const variable is block scope.</li>
        <li>It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.</li>
        <li>It cannot be declared without initialization.</li>
        <li>It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.</li>
        <li>Hoisting is done, but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the const variable before
            declaration/initialization</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>2. What is the difference between regular function and arrow function?</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Regular :</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.
            The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript,
            there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.
            During a simple invocation the value of this equals to the global object (or undefined if the function runs
            in strict mode)</li>
        <li>As seen in the previous section, the regular function can easily construct objects.</li>
        <li>Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the list of arguments with which the function has been invoked.</li>
        <li>return expression statement returns the result from a function:</li>
        <li>The regular functions are the usual way to define methods on classes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Arrow :</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's this
        behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.
        No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value from
         the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this lexically.</li>
        <li>A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a constructor.

            If you try to invoke an arrow function prefixed with new keyword, JavaScrip throws an error</li>
        <li>On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.

            Again (same as with this value), the arguments object is resolved lexically: the arrow function accesses arguments from the outer function.</li>
        <li>You can return values from the arrow function the same way as from a regular function, but with one useful exception.

            If the arrow function contains one expression, and you omit the function's curly braces, then the expression is implicitly returned. These are the inline arrows function.</li>
        <li>Thanks to Class fields proposal (at this moment at stage 3) you can use the arrow function as methods inside classes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>3. what is the difference between map, foreach, filter & find?</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>map :</strong>
        .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</p>
        <p><strong>forEach :</strong>
            .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</p>
            <p><strong>filter :</strong>
                .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
                <p><strong>find :</strong>
                    .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail â€” this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>4. Why use template string?</strong></h3>
        <p>Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

            Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.</p>
